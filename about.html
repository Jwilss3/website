            <p class="bold">About</p><br>
            <br>
            By the 1800s cats were very popular as pets across the world.
                London was home to the first cat show in 1871 and The National Cat Club of Great Britain (the first cat association) was formed in 1887.
                Although cats have been popular pets for a long time now it is only more recently that domestic cats have begun to live indoors.
                Only 70 years ago most cats would’ve lived outside. </p>
            <p class="bold">Communication</p><br>
            <br>
            Cats communicate by marking trees, fence posts, or furniture with their claws or their waste. These
            scent
            posts are meant to inform others of a cat's home range. House cats employ a vocal repertoire that
            extends from a purr to a screech.
